# Refactor Tractor

## Abstract
Refactor Tractor is a Turing Mod2 project in which we were given a code base for a Fitlit health tracker app. We were tasked to upgrade it with new features as well as refactor the code base. We implemented Sass, jQuery, Webpack, chai-spies and Fetch methods GET and POST. We also refactored for accessiblity, cross-browser/platform compatibilty as well as the overall principles of DRY and SRP.
